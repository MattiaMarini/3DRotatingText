# 3DRotatingText

3D Rotating Text is an App that utilizes the image recognition capabilities of ARKit in order to recognize fisical objects
and render 3D Texts using the recognized image name. The text are also rotating.

I am currently trying to add a functionality that will allow the users to take a picture themselves, insert the text they want
to be displayed, and from that moment the fisical object will be recognized and the text will be rendered on top of it.
